# Production-Project
This repo will be used to store any files and documents created or accessed during my production project.

This README.md will be used to keep track of the progress of the project, each commit of this file will show the progression of my research and development of my project.
## Project Supervisor: Cliffe Schreuders

Project idea: To create a hacktivity module that creates a vulnerable system with a software that hasn't been created before using Puppet.

### TO-DO:
- Create a Working Title based on the idea. DONE
- Look at Aims and Expectations of the project. DONE
- Start Filling in Risk Register and GAIT Document. (Start Soon: [10/10/2024])
- Start Specification Document to be submitted in November 2024. DONE
- Write about what documents to look as research.
- Begin the report required alongside the project.
- Look at setting up a vulnerable system using puppet to get a grasp of how puppet functions
- Look at completed puppet modules on the Sec-Gen Github, to get an idea of how the XML files are written.
- Create a functioning XML script then look at improving the sec-gen areas of the script.
- Research 5 Vulnerable Softwares, record them to a document/table.
- Write Literature Reviews for papers to support my research into the project.
- Research the puppet modules and how they function. 

More ToDos will be added as the project continues.

### USEFUL LINKS: 
- https://github.com/vulhub/vulhub : Repo Containing Vulnerable Software Environments

### Working Path:
- Look at setting up a puppet module on a VM set. (Setup explained via PP sent by Cliffe).
- Look at ~Metasploit Database~ Exploit-DB for Linux-Based Exploits with specific software.
- Research Software for plausibility of aquiring the vulnerable software.
- Attempt to set up the software manually to see the difficulty of setup.
- Once the VMs can be exploited using the vulnerability, look at starting the XML puppet module to automate the process prior.
